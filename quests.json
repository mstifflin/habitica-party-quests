How can we defeat it?\"<br><br>Why, the same way we defeat all beasts - with productivity! Quickly, Habitica, band together and strike through your tasks, and all of us will battle this monster together. (There's no need to abandon previous quests -  we believe in your ability to double-strike!) It won't attack us individually, but the more Dailies we skip, the closer we get to triggering its Neglect Strike - and I don't like the way it's eyeing the Tavern....",

Crowds of cheering Habiticans line the shores! We've helped Matt, Daniel, and Alex rebuild their buildings. But what's this?\n\n`The Citizens Return!`\n\nNow that the Drag'on has fled, thousands of sparkling colors are ascending through the sea. It is a rainbow swarm of Mantis Shrimp... and among them, hundreds of merpeople!\n\n\"We are the lost citizens of Dilatory!\" explains their leader, Manta. \"When Dilatory sank, the Mantis Shrimp that lived in these waters used a spell to transform us into merpeople so that we could survive. But in its rage, the Dread Drag'on trapped us all in the dark crevasse. We have been imprisoned there for hundreds of years - but now at last we are free to rebuild our city!\"\n\n\"As a thank you,\" says his friend @Ottl, \"Please accept this Mantis Shrimp pet and Mantis Shrimp mount, as well as XP, gold, and our eternal gratitude.\"\n\n`Rewards`\n * Mantis Shrimp Pet\n * Mantis Shrimp Mount\n * Chocolate, Cotton Candy Blue, Cotton Candy Pink, Fish, Honey, Meat, Milk, Potato, Rotten Meat, Strawberry",

Everything probably became deserts like this.”<br><br>“No wonder the ancients who founded Habitica stressed a balance of productivity and wellness,” the Joyful Reaper murmurs. “Rebuilding their world would have been a daunting task requiring considerable hard work, but they would have wanted to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again.”<br><br>“Oho, look at those formerly possessed items!” says the April Fool. Sure enough, all of them shimmer with a pale, glimmering translucence from the final burst of aether released when you laid Anti’zinnya’s spirit to rest. “What a dazzling effect.

As you observe the results, you notice that the two pets seem completely uninterested in one another!<br><br>“Did it not work?” @gully asks. But before anyone can answer, you suddenly realize that it isn't the potion that creates friendship and love, but rather it is the experience of working together toward a common goal. You come away from the quest having gained some new friends...and some flashy new pets!",
